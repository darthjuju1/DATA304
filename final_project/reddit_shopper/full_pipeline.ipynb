      "- Finally someone suggesting sidegrades to Netherite instead of suggesting Enderite, a new material which is better. Personally, I think that Mojang should have added a sidegrade to Netherite in the Ancient Cities when they released because it would have made a lot of sense. For the end version, I would really like a version where the item is crafted from some drop of insect mobs affected by BoA, because for some reason I associate the end with bugs.\n",

      "From worst to best, enderite is just super generic, overdone and kinda dull. It's to specific of a problem, to small of a niche. At least with netherite, the player encounters lava and fire all over the nether and many places in the overworld. Protecting from the void specifically is just so niche. How many times do you fall in the void in a given world? Once maybe? Mining it from under the island itself is also a super common idea. Prior to the happy ghast, it would just be a bit of messing with water buckets and elytra, or scouting it out and trying to guess where it was, but with the happy ghast, collecting it would be a breeze. \n",

We already have blast protection for protecting the player, which does a good job, I think another layer of explosion specific protection would make that explosives kinda trash as a damage source. Reducing explosion size is interesting, you could also go an opposite way to get a similar effect by modifying the hardness value of blocks if a player in rose gold is nearby. \n",

      "I have no idea why the explosion reistant option would be made from rubies, or why rubies somehow make rose gold. Usually it is made of an alloy of gold and copper, with small amounts of silver and zinc. Just call the set bejeweled or something and have it encrusted with gems maybe? \n",

The main problem here is just how you obtain it. 1 ingot per monument is okay for singleplayer, but servers with 20-50 people who all want a full set will SUFFER, especially when players die and need to make more. Aside from that, its a more niche bonus, but when its good its great, without being overpowered and power-creeping other options. Personally I would love if it made the player neutrally buoyant, so you didn't have to constantly adjust height while building underwater. Other than that, coming up with a non-structure limited source for the crafting ingredients would be great!\n",

What's also weird is that you gave every gear set something they survive, from netherite's immunity to burning, and for abyssalite, you just straight-up copied netherite's thing.

It feels too much like you just didn't know what to give the deep dark and not knowing where to put rubies, so you just combined two things that don't belong together.
