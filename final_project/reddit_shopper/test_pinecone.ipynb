From, a BB friend.\" So, I drove (that was a sketchy drive!) down to the springs near sunset, parked, and saw the sunset in the springs. All by myself, no one else around. It was AMAZING! I was making my way back up to my car and only then did I realize that I am stupid and was probably about to be murdered and my body never found. Obviously that didn\\'t happen! But, it was a great memory and one of those moments that I shake my head over. (I would like to say I learned my lesson here, but there were other sketchy car camping moments...)'},\n",
