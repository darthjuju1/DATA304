Looking for high waisted hiking pants for hot weather,"I see you're getting a lot of recs to buy men's pants, but in my experience as someone with a curvy body, men's pants never have enough room in the butt for me. I've had good luck with warm weather hiking pants from Duluth Trading (I also live in tick country :))

I like these two in particular. They're breathable and comfy and have pockets big enough to actually store things (one pair has three but the thigh pocket is quite large, the other has 5 or 6 pockets). I also treat them with permethrin for an extra layer of safety.

Most breathable and quick-drying women's hiking pants for humid hot weather,"Not sure what's wrong with the linen pants if they work for you. Who cares what they look like?

I use the mens version of the Columbia convertible pants

They're breathable and dry quickly in my experience, but there's only so much they can dry when it's super humid

Extremely hot weather: Merino or synthetics?,"I did a multi-day route through the Grand Canyon in August.  Temps were 100 - 115F (maybe even hotter on open desert).  I wore a long sleeve shirt from Solumbra, light pair of sun gloves from rei, wide brimmed hat, and a shemagah. 

Didn't get any sun burns and barely got tanned the entire trip.  I heartily would recommend the Solumbra brand.",rec2
Extremely hot weather: Merino or synthetics?,"I personally like both. A lightweight merino shirt and socks is really nice to wick away moisture and stay cooler.

As for synthetics I will ONLY buy nylon, because most others use polyester and in my experience once they start to smell. It's very very difficult to get those odors out of them. I have literally washed my polyester shirt before and it still smelled, right out of the wash. I have never had this issue with nylon.

You'll probably get more of a breeze and feel cooler with Merino, but nylon will probably give you better sun protection.

Edit: I live in TX where it's hot and humid in the summers. Over 100° every summer.",rec3
Which Fjallraven Pants are the Best for Hiking in 75F/25C Weather?,"I am also going on a hike this summer, so I ordered 3 pants: Vidda Pro Lite, Vidda Pro Ventilated and the Abisko Hybrid Trail. 
The one I kept was the Abisko Hybrid Trail. It has G-1000 Lite on the front and a nice stretchy back. The elastic waist really makes a nice fit. I tried them out on a sunny 20°C day already and it wasn‘t too hot. Uphill I opened the ventilation on the sides to get some airflow.
I am curious to test them in even hotter temperatures.",rec4
Which pants for summer travel and hot weather?,"First I would recommend the [**Renegade**](https://www.kuhl.com/kuhl/mens/pants/renegade-pant/?color=Koal). It's made of a lightweight material called DURALAX that is 95% nylon and 5% spandex. It's very stretchy, durable and dries quickly. The Renegade has multiple pockets including [zippered side pockets](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/cYMAAOSwXoBnpl3A/s-l1600.webp) that double as vents to dump heat.

I also recommend the [**Radikl**](https://www.kuhl.com/kuhl/mens/pants/radikl/). Its main body is made of a 68% cotton, 29% nylon and 3% spandex fabric that KUHL calls ENDURO. It's not as lightweight nor does it dry quite as quickly as the Renegade because of its cotton content. However, it's very comfortable with patented ""RHINOTEK"" design meaning it has special [panels made of nylon/spandex](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/64AAAOSwLtFnqjuY/s-l1600.webp) at key points along the legs, inseam and waist. This makes it really easy to move in and also adds to its breathability. Sadly it doesn't have a zip pocket which I do appreciate in hiking/travel pants for security.

I also own both the **Konfidant Air** and **Resistor Air** that you mentioned. The main differences are:

1. **Vents** \- The Konfidant Air has permanent open vents at the [back of the knee](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/8C4AAOSwLpRnqFG6/s-l1600.webp) and [near the crotch](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/bYUAAOSw4BFnqFG6/s-l1600.webp) as well as [side zip vents](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/-3UAAOSwZRtnqFG5/s-l1600.webp) while the Resistor Air just has [larger side zip vents](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/XDwAAOSwCA5nqGCs/s-l1600.webp).
2. **Waistband** \- The Konfidant Air has KUHL's standard ""Free Ryde"" waistband. It also has a French Fly meaning that there's a [secondary button closure](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/06kAAOSwyx1nqFG5/s-l1600.webp) below the main closure. It's meant to make the pants more secure but I didn't find it very useful so I don't use it. The Resistor Air has an elasticized waistband which is comfortably snug and doesn't have the French Fly.
3. **Pockets** \- The Konfidant Air has a [carpenter-style pocket on the right leg](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/-jMAAOSwaxpnqFG6/s-l1600.webp) and a horizontal [horizontal drop-in pocket](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/-3UAAOSwZRtnqFG5/s-l1600.webp) on the left leg while the Resistor Air has horizontal drop-in pockets on both legs. The Konfidant Air has [riveted front](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/AMYAAOSwiRpnqFG4/s-l1600.webp) and back pockets which add to the durability while the Resistor Air has non-riveted pockets.
4. **Material** \- The Konfidant Air is made of the same 68% cotton, 29% nylon and 3% spandex ENDURO fabric seen in the main body of the Radikl. The Resistor Air is made of 65% cotton, 30% nylon and 5% spandex. It feels a bit lighter than ENDURO material but is extremely prone to wrinkling.

Some other minor differences is that the Resistor Air also has a [reflective stripe](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/TmcAAOSwvwVnqGCt/s-l1600.webp) at the bottom cuffs that can be revealed if you roll them up and the articulation patterns are slightly different.",rec5
Dressing for hot weather in conservative Islamic/Muslim countries,"My time to shine! I live in Dubai, frequently work in Saudi Arabia, and have been a tourist in Morocco. Your post is basically my struggle six months a year. Morocco is not too conservative and I think you're worrying too much, but I'll tell you what I'd wear.

First off, shirts. In the cities in Morocco you'll be perfectly fine with t-shirts, or polos if you want to look a little better. Your skin color (guessing here) will be much more noticeable than your shirt and folks will be too interested in trying to talk to you, trying to sell you things, or both, to care about what you're wearing. For more rural areas I recommend linen shirts and lightweight polos, but again nobody will be offended if you're wearing less.

For pants (or trousers? Idk where you're from), I would recommend sticking to full leg covering if you can. Shorts will be tolerated in cities but you'll definitely look even more out of place. I wear jeans if I don't have to walk much but they get hot quickly and they don't do a great job with sweat. Instead, either go linen or if that style doesn't suit you, lightweight chinos. I've found good ones from both Uniqlo and Banana Republic. Get a light color but not white because those will be dirty by your second day.

For accessories, bring some dope sunglasses, preferably polarized. If you're going to be a taking a lot of Instagram or Tinder pictures bring a few pairs.
For feet, I recommend moisture-wicking socks and very breathable shoes. I have a pair of mesh hiking shoes that have become my go-to when I don't need to work. For hats, most people pretty much just wears baseball caps these days and you absolutely cannot pull off a Kufiyah, even if your Moroccan friends try to convince you that you can.

Other: anti-perspirant is your friend, get the heavy duty roll-on liquid. Water is also your friend,everyone knows dehydration gives you a great silhouette but it's not worth the tradeoff since hopefully you're already wearing pretty loose clothes.

Tldr: wear pants, but beyond that just stay comfortable.",rec6
sewing for hot weather travel,"For making your own gear I recommend the subreddit /r/myog, the wiki in the sidebar is a good place to start. 

My experience with tropical countries is that you want very airy fabrics. I recommend linen and viscose. Linen offers a bit more protection as it is generally a thicker fabric which is nice for walking in forests. I think a tank top is generally fine but personally I liked having a long sleeve option for added mosquito and sun protection.

I would not recommend wearing leggings. It's much more comfortable to wear flowy pants in hot and humid weather. 

In my experience underwear (even cotton) dries pretty quickly if the hotel room has air conditioning. Try air drying your underwear at home to see which ones dry the fastest.",rec7
sewing for hot weather travel,"If you're going somewhere hot and humid I would strongly discourage any kind of polyester! I see below you don't like linen so my recommendation is silk. With silk you don't want silk fabric that's tightly knitted/thick/warm, you want a loosely knitted breathable super thin silk fabric so that it can wick sweat while being breathable. My silk pants that are the right type of knit seem to be able to wick more sweat than technical fabrics (e.g. Uniqlo airism) and dry just as quickly. I highly recommend loosely fitting pants that go down to your ankles because covering up with breathable fabrics reduces the heat from the sun on your legs. If you're worried about bugs, use a bugspray that contains DEET (or better yet wipes if you don't have much space for liquids). If you're really worried about bugs you could sew an adjustable cuff into the bottom, but in my experience having an open wide hem on your pants vs cuffed pant leg makes a HUGE difference in terms of how cool it keeps you.",rec8
Light alpine hiking pants for summer use?,"I don't know if you're EU or USA based but I used to avoid hiking pants, wearing shorts pretty much all the time and only begrudgingly wearing some Kuhl convertible pants if I really needed pants (winter).  This summer I was in the Sierra during mosquito season so I wanted some lightweight pants.  I tried on Prana Zions, Kuhl Renegade, and REI Trailmade pants and went with the Trailmade.  They are quite thin and lightweight but seem durable with no damage after a week of backpacking, sitting on granite, some bushwhacking, etc.  Thin enough where I didn't get hot in them and they dried quickly.  Water beads up on them.  I think they were a good buy for only $70.

"A Travel Pants Review: Lululemon, Western Rise, Outdoor Research, and more!","What do you use them for? I got the Western Rise wear quite casual / technical. I’m not sure they can be used with polos etc for work. 

Never had an issue with ABCs. I tried evolution as they pack smaller and the sale price was great but I’m not convinced they extend to slacks and polos workwear like the ABC can.",rec10
Recs for hiking in hot weather??,"Did the mighty 5 this summer! I loved the rektrek shorts, helped with the beat a lot and I hiked angels landing in them! Normal shorts rub my thighs but these did well. I also work my tech sweat core leggings a lot, stayed up well during hiking and cooler than some other leggings. Would recommend some type of hiking shoe, not sneakers obvi. Definitely go as early as possible, especially in Moab. Arches was so hot. 

Let me know if you have more specific questions!",rec11
How are Fjallraven pants in hot weather?,"I have a pair of both the vidda pro's in question as well as barent's pro. In my experience, they are not nearly as breathable as my pair of eddie bauer guide pro pants. That may change however if you decide to wash off the greenland wax to allow for better air permeability, but obviously at the cost of removing the water repellancy of the material. I wear my guide pro pants during humid/hot summers, and usually opt for the vidda pro/barents pro when the temperature dips below 20 degrees Celsius.",rec12
How are Fjallraven pants in hot weather?,"I've owned and worn the Fjallraven Karl zip-off style ""trousers"" for 3 years in every season. As others have mentioned, they would not be your MOST breathable option in the height of summer but that's also not really their main strength - in my opinion, there is no better all purpose outdoor pant for the utility, durability and wearability. If you're just hiking on established trails, these pants (at least my style) are overkill - but if you're breaking or working trails or, in my case, doing work outdoors these are great for their function without being too heavy or hot.

Here's what I DO do to ensure airflow and functionality across all 4 seasons:

- in Winter I heavily wax the entire pant, front and back, with the Fjallraven-brand Greenland Wax and add an extra later of Filson-brand ""tin pants oil"" to the lower half of the pant legs for added waterproofing and durability (the zip off section, in my case). This works great for keeping out snow, fighting briars and breaking wind. I do NOT wash my pants all winter...you could stand them up in a corner by the end of the season they're so impregnated with wax. 

- in Spring, I wash out all the existing wax and, here's the key, I wax ONLY the fronts of the pants and all the way around at the ankles. This allows the G-1000 blend fabric to breath from the back but repel water and briars / brush from the front. FWIW, I also spray with a Permetherin clothing-specific tick repellant at this time because they're awful here

- in Summer, I wash all the wax out and just wear them as bare G-1000 and often either zip open the legs at the knee for air or take the legs off all together. If I know I'm going to be in a deluge, I bring along a bagged pair of rain over-pants.

- in early Fall, I start the cycle over again by waxing the fronts and, eventually, waxing the whole pant for woodcutting and brush clearing season

Lastly, the big plus for me is that I find the fit on Fjallraven clothing to be excellent and that is not a small consideration for an item I wear almost every day but it's also a personal choice. I describe it to newcomers to the brand as not quite Patagonia slim but not quite North Face oversized. It's an athletic cut for people with some meat on their bones.

Hope this helps, I would say confidently if you're using these for more than trail running you will be very happy.",rec13
