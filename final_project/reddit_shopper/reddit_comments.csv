Really one of the most amazing natural sites in the world. 

I planned to return to trek the backcountry routes in 2017, but I changed my plans last minute. The same day I was planning on doing the trek, a massive 7.0 earthquake occurred in these mountains and triggered nearly 2,000 landslides, covering most of the lakes we can see in the pictures above. I can‚Äôt imagine if I could have survived in a tent somewhere up in those mountains. Thank God I never did that trek.

""Red, if you ever get out of here, do me a favor. There's this big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is? ... One in particular. Got a long rock wall with a big oak at the north end. Like something out of a Robert Frost poem. It's where I asked my wife to marry me. We'd gone for a picnic. We made love under that tree. I asked and she said yes. (beat) Promise me, Red. If you ever get out, find that spot. In the base of that wall you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield. A piece of black volcanic glass. You'll find something buried under it."""

Someone had put a note under the wiper that read: ""You should see the sunset at the springs. From, a BB friend."" So, I drove (that was a sketchy drive!) down to the springs near sunset, parked, and saw the sunset in the springs. All by myself, no one else around. It was AMAZING! I was making my way back up to my car and only then did I realize that I am stupid and was probably about to be murdered and my body never found. Obviously that didn't happen! But, it was a great memory and one of those moments that I shake my head over. (I would like to say I learned my lesson here, but there were other sketchy car camping moments...)"

The CDT is one of the three ""triple crown"" trails. The others are the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail. Most of the world agrees that the CDT is the most difficult by a very large margin. Here are a few folks braving the CDT, used for a sense of scale in the massive landscapes."
